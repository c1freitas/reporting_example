## Example Reporting Application

The reporting application is expected to be run via Docker Compose. There is a makefile with the major commands.

You can run `make` from the base directory to get a list of commands

### Requirements
- Docker
- Make

### Running

Start the application with 

`> make docker-run`

You can seed the database via 

`> make docker-init`

To stop the application

`> make docker-stop`

### Known Issues
There is some issues with the start up order. While there is a dependency on the DB for the application defined in docker compose,it is possible for the db to not be finished initilizing before the application attempts to connect to it.

At times docker compose will complain about the volume for the reporting application with a: 
```
ERROR: The image for the service you're trying to recreate has been removed. If you continue, volume data could be lost. Consider backing up your data before continuing.
```
You can safely continue. 

There are no unit tests yet, all testing is manual. :(


### Next Steps

Next things to add would be:
1. Unit tests!
1. Add support for querying the data vs retreving it all
